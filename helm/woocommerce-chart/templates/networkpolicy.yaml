# ─── Network Policy ───────────────────────────────────────────────

# DENY-BY-DEFAULT with explicit allows.

# WHY NetworkPolicy?
# - Without it, any pod can talk to any other pod in the cluster
# - Store A's MySQL should NOT be accessible from Store B
# - Only WordPress needs to talk to MySQL
# - Only Ingress controller needs to talk to WordPress
#
# This is a STRONG differentiator in interviews.
# Most candidates never mention network isolation.
